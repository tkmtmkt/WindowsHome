# Colors
# ------

# The colors in the UI can be customized. In addition to the colors used
# for the UI you can also define new colors to use in the pager, blob,
# diff, and stage views by placing the text to match for in quotes.
#
# Prefix the name of a view to set a color only for that view, e.g.
#
#	color grep.file blue default
#
# As an example, this setting will to color Signed-off-by lines with a
# yellow foreground color and use the default background color.
#
#	color "    Signed-off-by"	yellow	default
#
# Note the four leading spaces in the string to match. This is because
# Git automatically indents commit messages by four spaces.

color "commit "			yellow	default
color "author "			yellow	default
color date			green	default
